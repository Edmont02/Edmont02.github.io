  <h1>Portfolio of Emily D. Montgomery</h1>
  <h3>Welcome!</h3>

  <p>*My website is still currently under construction.*</p>
  <p>My name is Emily D. Montgomery and I am a Computer Science major at the University of Louisville. My projected graduation date is August 2025.</p>
  <p>I am currently working on a few personal projects, such as: 
    1. Building my own personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (+ others as needed) 
    2. Learning how to navigate and create games in Unity and Unreal Engine 
    3. Learning how to create art and animations using Blender 
    4. Create an app for Apple and Android (I am still pondering a few ideas for the app)</p>

  <p>For this website, my plans are to have an about me section, my resume, and the current projects I am working on with periodic updates. As I learn more in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, my hopes are to enhance my website in quality.</p>
  <p>Please feel free to check back for updates at any time! My intentions are to make updates every 1-2 weeks.</p>

  <h5>Thanks for visiting!</h5>
