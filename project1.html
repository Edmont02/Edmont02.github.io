                Demon's Fall: The Rise of the Demigod is an 8-bit style fighting game created as part of a group project for my C/C++ Programming Class.
                The story behind this retro-inspired fighting game encompasses a demon who is bringing hell on earth, and the only one who can save humanity is the
                demigod.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being that this C/C++ class is typically taken in the first year and is a part of the introductory courses to Computer Science, our knowledge and
                confidence in coding projects was still building at this point. We kept our limitations in mind as we discussed how we would make our game, while still
                wanting to make it challenging and engaging for us. Since gaming engines could not be a part of this project, we utilized a gaming library called Raylib.
                We designated tasks amongst ourselves to evenly split up the work, keeping in mind each contributors strengths and interests. I got to take
                part in coding the graphics for the game, as well as player movements.
            </p>

            <p>
                When coming up with the story for our game, we wanted there to be a reason for the fighting in the first place. We wanted a bit of a gothic vibe, drawing
                a bit of inspiration from games like Mortal Kombat. Furthermore, we discussed how the gameplay would work and how we would need to break these up into tasks.
                These were the components of building the game that we came up with:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Start, Play, and Ending Screens</li>
                <li>Graphics</li>
                <li>Number of Players</li>
                <li>Player Movement</li>
                <li>Attack Moves</li>
                <li>Health of Each Player</li>
                <li>Scoring</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Since we were just beginning to learn programming and game development, we decided to make it a two-player game, where one person could play as the demigod
                and the other could play as the demon. Ideally, we would have wanted for the demon to have some form of intelligence, however, due to time constraints (this was
                a part of a class project) and knowledge limitations, we did not implement this into our game. As such, there is no option for one player, there is only
                two player. Futhermore, the demon was coded to fall to the floor after several seconds of movement to try to give an advantage to the demigod player, since the demon
                had the advantage of being in the air. The game ends whenever a player is K.O.ed (three hits). There are three outcomes to the game: demigod wins, demon wins, or a tie.
